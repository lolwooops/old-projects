# Abstract

This is a time-series analysis used for forecasting the price of the commodity, bananas. To conduct this analysis the original data set was examined to identify trend and seasonal components. Since this data set had both components, transformations were made, followed by using the minimum AIC and BIC for model selection. Once the model was selected, and diagnostics were completed, it was used to forecast the price of bananas to the year 2020. The expected price will increase to $1150 USD/Metric Ton by 2020. 

# Introduction

The intent of this paper is to forecast the price of Bananas. This paper uses time-series modeling techniques.The data was collected from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis webpage, and ranges from January 1998 to December 2017 (FRED, 2017).

Bananas are a type of fruit that is consumed worldwide for its nutritional value and the availability of Bananas throughout the year (Britannica T.E, 2018). The main type banana that is exported is the Cavendish Banana (Britannica T.E, 2018). Though bananas can be frozen and used for baking, they are most commonly consumed fresh and therefore it is important for suppliers to always have a new supply of bananas for their customers (Britannica T.E, 2018).

There are a few important considerations when evaluating the price of bananas, the first is evaluating if there exists a seasonal component and a trend component. These components might occur because Banana plants only fruit once in their lifetime, and the banana crop is mostly exported (Britannica T.E, 2018). When banana plants fruit they only produce about 50 to 150 bananas each, once a banana plant has fruited, it's trunk is cut down to the ground and will be replaced by a rhizome where it will take between 9 to 12 months for the plant to fruit again (Britannica T.E, 2018),(Banana Link, n.d). Therefore, this paper will be evaluating the seasonal components and the trend components of the price of bananas overtime.

# Methodology
## Original Time Series Plot
To begin analysis of the stock price of Bananas a plot of the price and the date was created, and is shown in Figure 1.


In Figure 1, there appears to be a seasonal effect on the price of bananas. This is noticed because of the rhythmic spikes and drops in the price that appears to follow a similar trend throughout multiple years.

A linear regression line was fitted to the data which has positive slope indicating that there is likely an increasing trend in the price of bananas since 1997.

A local regression (loess) curve was fitted to the data. This adds a smooth curve to all of the data. The loess curve is used to gauge the fit of the linear regression model, where a good model would have a loess model similar to the linear regression model. Since the loess model and the linear regression model deviate significantly, it requires further analysis and adjustments to the data.

```{r Original TS, fig.height=3, fig.width=7}
banana_price %>%
ggplot(
aes(
x = Date
,y = Price
)
) +
geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, colour = "#66c2a5") +
geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, colour = "#fc8d62") +
geom_line() +
labs(
title = "Figure 01: Banana Price"
,y = "Price (USD/Metric Ton)"
)
```


## Orginial Seasonal Plot

```{r Seasonal Price by Year, fig.height=3,fig.width=7}
banana_price %>%
group_by(Season, Year) %>%
summarize(`Mean Price` = mean(Price)) %>%
ggplot(
aes(
x = Year
,y = `Mean Price`
,colour = Season
)
) +
geom_line() +
scale_color_brewer(
type = "seq"
,palette = "Set2"
) +
labs(
title = "Figure 02: Seasonal Mean Banana Price"
,y = "Price (USD/Metric Ton)"
,colour = "Month"
)
```

In Figure 02, the price of bananas was observed over each year, and stratified by the four seasons. From the seasonal plot, each month appears to follow a similar overall increasing trend in the price from 1997. In the graph, the spring months are the highest priced months over the time frame while fall months generally have the lowest prices over the time period. The winter and the summer months are generally in between. This indicates that over the time-series there is likely a seasonal component to this data, which is investigated further in Figure 03.


```{r Price Violin Plot}
banana_price %>%
ggplot(
aes(
x = Season
,y = Price
)
) +
geom_violin(fill = NA) +
geom_boxplot(fill = NA, width = 0.1, outlier.colour = NA) +
geom_jitter(aes(colour = Year)) +
facet_wrap(
~ Season
,nrow = 1
,scales = "free_x"
) +
scale_color_distiller(
type = "seq"
,palette = "RdYlBu"
) +
labs(
title = "Figure 03: Seasonal Banana Price Violin Plot"
,y = "Price (USD/Metric Ton)"
) +
theme(
axis.text.x = element_blank()
,axis.title.x = element_blank()
)
```

In Figure 03, violin plots of the price of bananas were separated by the season. Winter included December, January and February; spring included March, April and May; summer included June, July and August; and fall included September, October and November. Overall the trend shows that the mean and the median for the price of bananas in the spring is the highest, and the mean lowest price of bananas happens in the fall. From this, it can be concluded that there is some seasonal affect on the price of bananas.

Figure 03 also shows the price of bananas and the year as coloured points. These points show an overall trend that the cost of bananas has been increasing since 1998, as we can see the change in the colour from blue (indicating the earlier years) at the bottom and red (indicating the later years) at the top. Figure 04 shows this more clearly.

```{r Monthly Price by Year, fig.height=3,fig.width=7}
banana_price %>%
ggplot(
aes(
x = `Month Name`
,y = Price
,colour = Year
,group = Year
)
) +
geom_line() +
scale_colour_distiller(
type = "div"
,palette = "RdYlBu"
) +
labs(
title = "Figure 04: Banana Price by Month"
, y = "Price (USD/Metric Ton)"
, x = "Month"
)
```
According to Figure 04, there has been an increase in the price of Bananas over the last twenty years. Banana prices have approximately doubled between 1998 and 2018, though the prices have been relatively steady in approximately the last 7 years. This may indicate that inflationary effects have been relatively muted since 2010.


## Lagged Scatter Plot
```{r Lagged Scatter Plot, fig.height=5, fig.width=5}
banana_lagged <-
banana_price %>%
mutate(
`Lag 01` = lag(Price, n = 1)
,`Lag 02` = lag(Price, n = 2)
,`Lag 03` = lag(Price, n = 3)
,`Lag 04` = lag(Price, n = 4)
,`Lag 05` = lag(Price, n = 5)
,`Lag 06` = lag(Price, n = 6)
,`Lag 07` = lag(Price, n = 7)
,`Lag 08` = lag(Price, n = 8)
,`Lag 09` = lag(Price, n = 9)
,`Lag 10` = lag(Price, n = 10)
,`Lag 11` = lag(Price, n = 11)
,`Lag 12` = lag(Price, n = 12)
)

banana_lagged %>%
gather(
key = Lag
,value = `Lagged Price`
,-Date
,-Year
,-Month
,-`Month Name`
,-Season
,-Day
,-Price
,-R_a
) %>%
filter(!is.na(`Lagged Price`)) %>%
ggplot(
aes(
x = Price
,y = `Lagged Price`
)
) +
geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, colour = "#66c2a5") +
geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, colour = "#fc8d62") +
facet_wrap(~ Lag) +
labs(
title = "Figure 05: Lag Scatter Plot"
,x = "Price (USD/Metric Ton)"
,y = "Lagged Price (USD/Metric Ton)"
)
```

Figure 05 show the lag plots at each month in our data set. The lag plots are showing the potential correlation between one lag and the previous lag. In these plots we are comparing the first month to all the other months. There appears to be significant correlation in lags 1 through 4, and in lags 4 through 12 the distribution appears to be more random.

```{r Lagged Correlation, fig.height=3,fig.with=3}
banana_lagged %>%
select(`Lag 00` = Price, starts_with("Lag")) %>%
ggcor(lb = 0.7, use = "complete.obs") +
labs(title = "Figure 06: Lagged Correlation Plot")
```

Figure 06 is a correlation plot between the lags. In general the correlations range from around 0.75 to perfect correlation. It can be seen that the correlation remains very high (between 0.85 and 1) within the first 4 lags, then starts to decrease below 0.8.

## Autocorrelation Function and Partial Autocorrelation Function

```{r Price ACF, fig.height=4,fig.width=7}
ggacf(banana_price, col = Price, type = "correlation") + labs(title = "Figure 07: Price ACF")
```

Figure 07 is a plot of the Autocorrelation function, which is checking the correlation between a lag and the previous lag. In this case, there is a gradual decrease in the spikes along the plot, which might indicate that there is some autoregressive component required in the model.

```{r Price PACF, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
ggacf(banana_price, col = Price, type = "partial") + labs(title = "Figure 08: Price PACF")
```

In the Partial Autocorrelation plot in Figure 08, there is a significant spike at lag 1, followed by correlations that are mostly not significant, therefore it is suspected that this has an autoregressive component. Furthermore, there are noticeable spikes approximately every 4 lags, indicating a seasonality component.

## Transformations
Since there are both seasonal and trend components in the Banana Price data set, transformations are required. Multiple different transformations were tested on the Banana Price data set and can be seen in Figure 09. Note that once again the orange line represents the results from fitting a linear regression model while the green line represents the results from fitting a loess regression model.

The first transformation was to take the log of the Banana Price. This transformation did not have a significant impact on removing the trend or the seasonality from the data set.

The second transformation was using the Box-Cox method in R. Again, there was not a significant reduction in the trend or the seasonality of the data set.

The third transformation performed was to change the data set from the stock price of bananas to the return of the bananas. The new data set, Banana Return, resulted in a significant reduction to the trend of the Banana Price.

Following the initial transformation of the Banana Price to Banana Return, additional transformations were conducted to further reduce the trend.

A transformation was applied by taking the log of the Banana Return. This transformation also had a significant effect on the removal of trend in the Banana Return data set.

A Box-Cox transformation was also performed on the Banana Return data set, this transformation did not result in any significant removal of the trend in the Banana Return data set.

Therefore, due to the ease of interpretation and removal of trend, the Banana Return and the log of Banana Return will be used for further modeling of the Price of Bananas.

## Transformation Time-Series Plot
```{r Trans TS Plot, fig.height=6,fig.width=7}
banana_price <-
banana_price %>%
mutate(
`Log Price` = log(Price)
,`Log Return` = log(1 + R_a)
,`Box Cox Price` = BoxCox(Price, lambda = BoxCox.lambda(Price))
,`Box Cox Return` = BoxCox(Price, lambda = BoxCox.lambda(R_a))
)

,scales = "free_y"
,ncol = 1
) +
labs(title = "Figure 09: Time Series Plot of Transformations")
```

```{r Seasonal Return on Bananas Violin Plot}
banana_price %>%
select(
Year
,Season
,R_a
,`Log Return`
) %>%
gather(
key = Transformation

,-Year
,-Season
) %>%
ggplot(

)
) +
geom_violin(fill = NA) +
geom_boxplot(fill = NA, width = 0.1, outlier.colour = NA) +
geom_jitter(aes(colour = Year)) +
facet_grid(

,scales = "free_x"
) +
scale_color_distiller(

,palette = "RdYlBu"
) +
labs(

,y = "Monthly Return (%)"
) +
theme(
axis.text.x = element_blank()
,axis.title.x = element_blank()
)
```

Figure 10 displays violin plots separating the banana data by season. After the transformation the effects of the increasing trend have been removed. This is observed as the data points are not showing the same trend where the earlier years, seen in blue, appeared near the bottom and the later years, seen in red, appeared near the top and the observed pattern is more random. In addition, the median of the log Banana Return, is more consistent, indicating a reduction in seasonal effects.

```{r Return on Bananas by Month}
banana_price %>%
select(
Year
,`Month Name`
,R_a
,`Log Return`
) %>%
gather(
key = Transformation
,value = Value
,-Year
,-`Month Name`
) %>%
ggplot(
aes(
x = `Month Name`
,y = Value
,colour = Year
,group = Year
)
) +
geom_line() +
facet_wrap(
~ Transformation
,ncol = 1
) +
scale_colour_distiller(
type = "div"
,palette = "RdYlBu"
) +
labs(
title = "Figure 11: Return on Bananas by Month"
, y = "Monthly Return (%)"
, x = "Month"
)
```

From Figure 11, the elimination of the trend in the data set is apparent since the gradual increasing trend from the earlier years, in blue, and the later years, in red, is no longer present. Additionally, the plot also shows that there is higher variation on return rate during the earlier years compared to the later years.

## Transformation Autocovariance Function

```{r Return AcF and PACF}
banana_R_a_acf <- ggacf(banana_price, col = R_a, type = "correlation") + labs(title = "R_a ACF")
banana_R_a_pacf <- ggacf(banana_price, col = R_a, type = "partial") + labs(title = "R_a PACF")
banana_log_ret_acf <- ggacf(banana_price, col = `Log Return`, type = "correlation") + labs(title = "Log Return ACF")
banana_log_ret_pacf <- ggacf(banana_price, col = `Log Return`, type = "partial") + labs(title = "Log Return PACF")
grid.arrange(banana_R_a_acf, banana_R_a_pacf, banana_log_ret_acf, banana_log_ret_pacf, top = "Figure 12: ACF & PACF Plots for Return on Bananas")
```

The plots in Figure 12 all show a significant correlation at the first lag, followed by correlations that are not significant. This is a good indicator of stationarity.

## Decomposition of Transformation

To confirm if there exists a trend or seasonal component in the Banana Price, the Banana Return and the Log of the Banana Return data sets, the decomposition method was used. In addition plots for the decompositions are created for the Banana Price and Log Return models.

```{r Decomposition Stats}
banana_price_decomp <-
banana_price$Price %>%
ts(frequency = 12) %>%
stl(s.window = "periodic")

banana_ra_decomp <-
banana_price$R_a %>%
ts(frequency = 12) %>%
stl(s.window = "periodic")

banana_logreturn_decomp <-
banana_price$`Log Return` %>%
ts(frequency = 12) %>%
stl(s.window = "periodic")

banana_price_decomp$time.series %>%

kable(
caption = "Price Decomposition Summary Statistics"
,digits = 4
,col.names = c("Seasonal", "Trend", "Remainder")
)
banana_ra_decomp$time.series %>%
summary() %>%
kable(

,digits = 4
,col.names = c("Seasonal", "Trend", "Remainder")
)
banana_logreturn_decomp$time.series %>%
summary() %>%
kable(
caption = "Log Return Decomposition Summary Statistics"
,digits = 4
,col.names = c("Seasonal", "Trend", "Remainder")
)
```


```{r Price Decomposition Plot, fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
banana_price %>%
select(
Date
,Year
,Month
,`Month Name`
,Day
,Price
) %>%
bind_cols(
banana_price_decomp$time.series %>%
data.frame() %>%
as_tibble() %>%
rename(
Remainder = remainder
,Seasonal = seasonal
,Trend = trend
)
) %>%
rename(Data = Price) %>%
gather(
key = Decomposition
,value = Price
,-Date
,-Year
,-Month
,-`Month Name`
,-Day
) %>%
mutate(
Decomposition = factor(Decomposition, levels = c("Data", "Trend", "Seasonal", "Remainder"))
) %>%
ggplot(
aes(
x = Date
,y = Price
)
) +
geom_line() +
facet_wrap(
~ Decomposition
,ncol = 1
,scales = "free_y"
) +
labs(
title = "Figure 13: Banana Prices Decomposition"
,y = "Price (USD/Metric Ton)"
)
```

From Table 1, we see that the mean seasonal effect of banana prices is -0.02578, the mean trend effect is 707.4, and the mean remainder effect is -0.6704. As is evidenced in the decomposition plot, the main effect is largely dominated by the trend, indicating non-stationarity. 

```{r Log Return Decomposition Plot, fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
banana_price %>%
select(
Date
,Year
,Month
,`Month Name`
,Day
,`Log Return`
) %>%
bind_cols(
banana_logreturn_decomp$time.series %>%
data.frame() %>%
as_tibble() %>%
rename(
Remainder = remainder
,Seasonal = seasonal
,Trend = trend
)
) %>%
rename(Data = `Log Return`) %>%
gather(
key = Decomposition
,value = `Log Return`
,-Date
,-Year
,-Month
,-`Month Name`
,-Day
) %>%
mutate(
Decomposition = factor(Decomposition, levels = c("Data", "Trend", "Seasonal", "Remainder"))
) %>%
ggplot(

)
) +
geom_line() +
facet_wrap(
~ Decomposition
,ncol = 1
,scales = "free_y"
) +
labs(title = "Figure 14: Banana Log Returns Decomposition")
```

From Table 3, we see that the mean seasonal effect for the log returns is 0.0002305\%, the mean trend effect is 0.001110\%, and
the mean remainder effect is 0.0002209\%. In Figure 14: The Banana Log Returns and the Remainder show a similar pattern. This is evidence that there is no significant seasonal nor trend component in the model.

## ADF Test (Dickey's Test)

The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test is used to evaluate whether the time-series of Banana Price, Banana Return and the Banana Log Return are stationary or integrated. The Price model is not stationary at lag 12, but is stationary at lag 6. The Return and Log Return models are both stationary at lags 6 and 12.

```{r ADF}
suppressWarnings(
  banana_price %>%
  {adf.test(.$Price, alternative = "stationary")} %>%
    pander()
)
suppressWarnings(
  banana_price %>%
  {adf.test(.$Price, alternative = "stationary", k = 12)} %>%
    pander()
)

suppressWarnings(
  banana_price %>%
  {adf.test(.$R_a, alternative = "stationary")} %>%
    pander()
)
suppressWarnings(
  banana_price %>%
  {adf.test(.$R_a, alternative = "stationary", k = 12)} %>%

## Model Selection 

We consider three different methods for model selection, the auto.arima function and the models that minimize AIC and BIC. We decided to consider the Log Return data set for the model selection process, since it was the more easily interpreted stationary model.

### Auto ARIMA



```{r Auto-ARIMA}
# banana_price_autoarima_01 <- auto.arima(banana_price$Price, seasonal = TRUE)
# summary(banana_price_autoarima_01)
# 
# banana_ra_autoarima_01 <- auto.arima(banana_price$R_a, seasonal = TRUE)
# summary(banana_ra_autoarima_01)

banana_log_ret_autoarima_01 <- auto.arima(banana_price$`Log Return`, seasonal = TRUE)
summary(banana_log_ret_autoarima_01)
```

The model recommended by the auto.arima function is an ARIMA(1,0,1) model such that

$$\phi(B)\Phi(B^s)Y_t= \theta(B)\Theta(B^s)Z_t $$ where $$\phi(z) = 1-\phi_1(z)-...-\phi_pz^p,\Phi(z) = 1-\Phi_1(z)-...-\Phi_pz^p $$
$$\theta(z) = 1+\theta_1z+...+\theta_qz^q, \Theta(z) = 1+\Theta_1z+...+\Theta_qz^q $$
Auto-ARIMA(1,0,1) where $$\phi(z) = 1-0.7300z$$
$$\theta(z) = 1-0.9256z$$

### Minimum AIC and BIC
We then evaluate the different possible ARIMA(p,d,q) models and attempt to minimize for AIC and BIC.
```{r min AIC BIC, cache=TRUE}
pdqPDQ <-
  0:1 %>% 
  rep(times = 3, each = 2) %>% 
  combn(m = 6) %>% 
  t()

banana_arima_builder <- function(pdq){
  banana_arima <-
    Arima(
      y = banana_price$`Log Return`
      ,order = pdq[1:3]
      ,seasonal = pdq[4:6]
    )
    banana_aic <- banana_arima$aic
    banana_bic <- AIC(banana_arima, k = as.numeric(count(banana_price)))
    list(
      p = pdq[1]
      ,d = pdq[2]
      ,q = pdq[3]
      ,P = pdq[4]
      ,D = pdq[5]
      ,Q = pdq[6]
      # ,arima = banana_arima
      ,AIC = banana_aic
      ,BIC = banana_bic
    )
}

banana_arima_stats <- 
  1:dim(pdqPDQ)[1] %>% 
  map(~ pdqPDQ[., ]) %>% 
  map_df(banana_arima_builder)

banana_min_aic <- 
  banana_arima_stats %>% 
  filter(AIC == min(AIC)) %>% 
  unique()
banana_min_aic %>% 
  kable(caption = "Minimum AIC")

banana_min_bic <- 
  banana_arima_stats %>% 
  filter(BIC == min(BIC)) %>% 
  unique()
banana_min_bic %>% 
  kable(caption = "Minimum BIC")

banana_aic_arima <- 
  banana_min_aic %>% 
  select(-AIC, -BIC) %>%
  mutate(`Model #` = 1:nrow(banana_min_aic)) %>%
  gather(
    key = Letter
    ,value = Num
    ,-`Model #`
  ) %>% 
  split(.$`Model #`) %>% 
  map(~ .$Num) %>% 
  map(
    ~ Arima(
      y = banana_price$`Log Return`
      ,order = .[1:3]
      ,seasonal = .[4:6]
    )
  )
# banana_aic_arima %>% 
#   map(summary)

# Just 1 entry
banana_aic_arima$`1` %>% 
  summary() %>% 
  pander()

banana_bic_arima <- 
  banana_min_bic %>% 
  select(-AIC, -BIC) %>%
  mutate(`Model #` = 1:nrow(banana_min_bic)) %>%
  gather(
    key = Letter
    ,value = Num
    ,-`Model #`
  ) %>% 
  split(.$`Model #`) %>% 
  map(~ .$Num) %>% 
  map(
    ~ Arima(
      y = banana_price$`Log Return`
      ,order = .[1:3]
      ,seasonal = .[4:6]
    )
  )
# banana_bic_arima %>% 
#   map(summary)

# Just 1 entry
banana_bic_arima$`1` %>% 
  summary() %>% 
  pander()
```

The ARIMA model that minimized AIC was such that

$$\phi(B)\Phi(B^s)Y_t= \theta(B)\Theta(B^s)Z_t $$ where $$\phi(z) = 1-\phi_1(z)-...-\phi_pz^p,\Phi(z) = 1-\Phi_1(z)-...-\Phi_pz^p $$
$$\theta(z) = 1+\theta_1z+...+\theta_qz^q, \Theta(z) = 1+\Theta_1z+...+\Theta_qz^q $$

Since it is an ARIMA(1,0,1) model, we have $$\phi(z) = 1-0.7573z$$ $$\theta(z) = 1-0.9568z $$

The recommended BIC model was an ARIMA(0,1,0)(0,1,1) model.

# Forecasting Banana Price
## Auto-ARIMA
From the autoARIMA model, the RMSE of the model is 0.130. Looking at the forecasted banana log return model, the expected forecast steadies around zero. The variance of the log return model can be seen to also be decreasing and approaching zero as well. In addition, we expect that the price will stay slightly under $1000 USD/Metric Ton for the next 3 years. A major assumption that is made for the 3 models is that the underlying patterns will be continue to be the same over the next 3 years.

## Minimum AIC

From the lowest AIC model, the RMSE of the model is 0.129. The RSME is the lowest of the 3 models, with the Auto-ARIMAs RSME of 0.130 being almost identical. Looking at the forecasted banana log return model, the expected forecast steadies around zero. In addition, over the past 10 years, the variance of the log return model is decreasing and approaching zero.

From the minimum AIC log returns model with respect to price, it is expected that the price will increase to $1150 USD/Metric Ton by 2020.

## Minimum BIC

From the lowest BIC model the RMSE of the model is 0.201, the largest RMSE of the models. The forecasted banana log returns suggests that the expected log return to be approximately 0, since the past 10 years have been close to 0 as well. Looking at the minimum BIC models plot with respect to price, it can be seen that the expected price is increasing slightly. However, the 95% confidence interval, the range of the interval is significantly larger than the other models, with the upper bound of the minimum BIC model being approximately 16000 which suggests that this may not be the best model to forecast.

In comparison of the 3 models, it was seen that the autoARIMA and the minimum AIC model had very similar conclusion and very similar confidence intervals. Using April 1st, 2018 as a benchmark, a comparison can be drawn between the 95% confidence interval of each model. The autoARIMA model forecasts that the price of bananas will be $975.5851 USD/Metric Ton with the true mean being between $748.2576 and $1271.978 USD/Metric Ton with 95% confidence. The minimum AIC model forecasts that the price of bananas will be $1071.504 USD/Metric Ton with the true mean being between $821.1925 and $1407.365 USD/Metric Ton with 95% confidence. As the minimum BIC model has such wide prediction intervals, it was not considered for forecasting.  Both the autoARIMA and minimum AIC models are compared to the actual price of the Cavendish bananas, of which is $1075.25 USD/Metric Ton. It can be seen that the minimum AIC's prediction is nearly identical to the actual price, suggesting the minimum AIC model is a better forecast model. Additionally, the minimum AIC model has the lowest RMSE and was chosen to be the final model.

Figure 23: ACF show slight jumps spikes at certain lags, but not enough to be significant. In addition, the Ljung-Box statistics are all significantly greater than 0.05, which indicates that the Residuals are independently distributed.

## Normality of Residuals

```{r}
std.res1<-residuals(banana_aic_arima$`1`)/sqrt(banana_aic_arima$`1`$sigma2)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
qqnorm(residuals(banana_aic_arima$`1`))
qqline(residuals(banana_aic_arima$`1`), col = 2,lwd=2,lty=2)
hist(std.res1,main="Figure 24: Standardized Residual")
hist(residuals(banana_aic_arima$`1`),main="Residual")
jarque.bera.test(residuals(banana_aic_arima$`1`)) 
```

From the Figure 24, the histograms are relatively symmetric at 0, with a mean of 0, this resembles white noise. In addition, the Jarque Bera test statistic is less than 0.05, thus indicating the the residuals are not normally distributed.

## Constant Variance
```{r}
plot(residuals(banana_aic_arima$`1`)[1:240], residuals(banana_aic_arima$`1`)[2:241], pch=20,main="Figure 25: Scatterplot of Residual with Lag 1") 
abline(h=0,lty=2)
```

In Figure 25, the points are randomly distributed around the 0 line, indicating that variances of residuals are random.

## Drift

```{r}
dataframe_res1<-data.frame(residuals(banana_aic_arima$`1`))
dataframe_dat1<-data.frame(banana_price$`Log Return`)
res<-cbind(dataframe_res1,dataframe_dat1)
```

```{r}
plot(res$banana_price..Log.Return.,res$residuals.banana_aic_arima.,main="Figure 26: Residual vs Order Data")
abline(h=0,lty=2)
```

From Figure 26, the residuals are not randomly scattered, thus indicating signs of drift.

## Homoscedasticity 
```{r}
banana_price$`Log Return` %>% 
  arima(
    order = banana_min_aic[1, 1:3] %>% t()
    ,seasonal = banana_min_aic[1, 4:6] %>% t()
  ) %>% 
  arch.test(output = FALSE)
```

The p-values indicate that the residuals of a ARIMA model is heteroscedastic.


# Model with Drift Diagnostics
## White Noise on Model with Drift

```{r}
tsdiag(banana_aic_arima_d)
tsdisplay(residuals(banana_aic_arima_d), lag.max=241, main='Figure 27: ARIMA(1,1,1)with drift Model Residuals')
```

From Figure 27 the autocorrelation function there are some small jumps spikes at certain lags, however they are not enough to be significant. The Ljung-Box statistics are all significantly greater than 0.05, indicating that the residuals are independently distributed.

## Normality of Residuals

```{r}
std.res2<-residuals(banana_aic_arima_d)/sqrt(banana_aic_arima_d$sigma2)
```

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
qqnorm(residuals(banana_aic_arima_d))
qqline(residuals(banana_aic_arima_d), col = 2,lwd=2,lty=2)
hist(std.res2,main="Figure 28: Standardized Residual")
hist(residuals(banana_aic_arima_d),main="Residual")
```

From Figure 28, the histograms are relatively symmetric at 0, with mean = 0, resembling white noise.

## Homoscedasticity

```{r}
jarque.bera.test(residuals(banana_aic_arima_d)) 
```

In addition, the Jarque Bera test statistic is less than 0.05, thus indicating the the residuals are not normally distributed.

## Constant Variance

```{r}
plot(residuals(banana_aic_arima_d)[1:240], residuals(banana_aic_arima_d)[2:241], pch=20, main="Figure 29: Scatterplot of Residual with Lag 1") 
abline(h=0,lty=2)
```

From Figure 29, the scatter plot shows random spread around 0 line, indicating variances of residuals are random.

## Drift

```{r}
dataframe_res2<-data.frame(residuals(banana_aic_arima_d))
dataframe_dat2<-data.frame(banana_price$`Log Return`)
res<-cbind(dataframe_res2,dataframe_dat2)
plot(res$banana_price..Log.Return.,res$residuals.banana_aic_arima_d.,main="Figure 30: Residual vs Order Data")
abline(h=0,lty=2)
```
# Diagnostic summary
From the ACF and PACF plots, we observed no sudden spikes that were significant.  In addition, the Ljung-Box statistics are all significantly greater than 0.05 at each lag, thus indicating that our residuals are independently distributed, and therefore do approximately resemble white noise.

When looking at the normal Q-Q plot for normality of our residuals, we saw slight deviation from the straight line at both ends of the graph, indicating that our residuals may not be normal. Though our histograms do seem to be normally distributed and symmetric at 0, the Jarque-Bera test yielded a p-value of approximately 0 thus indicating that our residuals are not normally distributed.
 
As for our constant variance assumption, we can see from our scatterplot of residuals that the points are randomly scattered around the zero line with no clear pattern, thus indicating that our residuals do have constant variance.

The process was repeated for the model, except this time we adjusted for potential drift. The diagnostic result was the same as our model without drift. That is, the residuals are approximately white noises and have constant variance. However, the data fails to satisfy the normality of residuals assumption.

In summary, our data seems to pass the assumption of white noise, and constant variance (regardless of drift). Unfortunately, our data did fail the normality of residuals assumption (even after transformation), thus indicating a deficiency in the model. Returns data generally follows a t-distribution, which has heavier tails than a normal distribution, which is the likely cause for this normality issue.

# Results

Based on the results of the model selection the minimum AIC model was chosen as the best model to forecast the price of Bananas. 
$$
  \phi(B)\Phi(B^s)Y_t= \theta(B)\Theta(B^s)Z_t
$$ 
where
$$
  \phi(z) = 1-\phi_1(z)-...-\phi_pz^p,\Phi(z) = 1-\Phi_1(z)-...-\Phi_pz^p
$$
AIC (1,0,1)
where
$$
  \phi(z) = 1-0.7573z
$$ 
$$
  \theta(z) = 1-0.9568z
$$
Using this model to forecast the price of bananas to April 1st 2018 the expected price of bananas is \$1071 USD per Metric Ton and the actual price of bananas was \$1160 USD per Metric Ton. There is some error in the forecasted value, this error is likely due to predicting the price based on data set that ended a year and half ago. 

Using the minimum AIC model the price of bananas was also forecasted to the year 2020, where the expected price will increase to $1150 USD/Metric Ton. This price is lower than the known price from April 1st 2018 and therefore a more accurate prediction for the price of bananas could be made more accurate by shortening the time between the end of the data set and the forecast date. 


# Conclusions

The analysis of the price of bananas shows that the price of bananas has been increasing since 1997, and in 2017 the price of bananas had doubled. The price of bananas was affected by the seasons and is usually highest during the northern hemispheres spring and the lowest during the northern hemispheres winter. The banana price data had seasonal components and trend and therefore transformations, model selection and diagnostics where used to determine the best model for forecasting the price of bananas. 

The recommended model for forecasting the price of bananas is the minimum AIC model. The minimum AIC model suggests that the price will continue to increase, which follows the trend over the last 20 years. 



In conclusion the forecasted price for bananas for April 1st 2018 is expected to be \$1071 USD per Metric Ton and the log return is expected to be 0.003377 and the expected price will increase to $1150 USD/Metric Ton by 2020.
